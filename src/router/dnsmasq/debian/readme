Notes on configuring dnsmasq as packaged for Debian.

(1) To configure dnsmasq edit /etc/dnsmasq.conf. The file is well
    commented; see also the dnsmasq.8 man page for explanation of
    the options. The file /etc/default/dnsmasq also exists but it
    shouldn't need to be touched in most cases. To set up DHCP
    options you might need to refer to a copy of RFC 2132. This is 
    available on Debian systems in the package doc-rfc-std as the file
    /usr/share/doc/RFC/draft-standard/rfc2132.txt.gz .

(2) If the Debian resolvconf package is installed then, regardless
    of what interface configuration daemons are employed, the list of
    nameservers to which dnsmasq should forward queries can be found
    in /var/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf; also, 127.0.0.1 is listed as the
    first nameserver address in /etc/resolv.conf. This works using the
    default configurations of resolvconf and dnsmasq.

(3) In the absence of resolvconf, if you are using dhcpcd then
    dnsmasq should read the list of nameservers from the automatically
    generated file /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf.  You should list 127.0.0.1
    as the first nameserver address in /etc/resolv.conf.

(4) In the absence of resolvconf, if you are using pppd then
    dnsmasq should read the list of nameservers from the automatically
    generated file /etc/ppp/resolv.conf.  You should list 127.0.0.1
    as the first nameserver address in /etc/resolv.conf.

(5) If you run multiple DNS servers on a single machine, each
    listening on a different interface, then it is necessary from
    version 2.3 on to use the bind-interfaces option by uncommenting
    "bind-interfaces" in /etc/dnsmasq.conf. This option stops dnsmasq
    from binding the wildcard address and allows servers listening on
    port 53 on interfaces not in use by dnsmasq to work. 

(6) From version 2.28, the ability to read lease-files from ISC dhcpd
    is not included in the Debian binary package. This facility is
    considered by upstream to be obsolete. The code still exists, and
    can be enabled by editing src/config.h and building from
    source. It is strongly suggested that you either use the
    DHCP server built in to dnsmasq, or, if you have a very complex DHCP
    configuration, the ISC server and BIND. For simple configurations, you
    can move to the builtin server by removing  the dhcp-leasefile
    configuration item, and adding a dhcp-range configuration.
