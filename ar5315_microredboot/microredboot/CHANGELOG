20.6.09
    * AR5312/AR2313: fix nvram erase for nor flash devices (tested)
    * make LzmaDecoder 2-3 times faster. this increases size, but we are still in 64 kb limit
    note:
    - finally the bootloader works now for ap51,ap65 and ap48 with all current planned features
    
19.6.09
    * AR5312/AR2313: nor flash support for erasing nvram on reset button long push (untested)
    * AR5312/AR2313: add support for 32MB ram chips (auto detection)
    * most nor flash chips should be supported, but no guarantee. redboot will display the required ID's for implementation
    * nvram partition will now be automaticly detected if present
    * 8 MB flash chip support for 5312/2313 (redboot modification)
    * support consolidated board data or not, doesnt matter. will be found
    * shows board type if present (taken from nvram)
    * erase nvram only if nvram was detected (to prevent breaking of filesystem if DD-WRT isnt installed, but another OS)
    note:
    - before using from source consider to adjust the dram refresh timing, since i had to decrease it for testing on my AP48
    - it will not have any negative influence if you dont do it, but dram access might be slower than expected

18.6.09
    * add more ap48/ar5312/ar2313 related support code and modify redboot to compile for this target
    * AP48 is still in progress and untested, do not use it if you dont know how to handle a jtag 
    
17.6.09
    * add nvram_get to boot_stub (for checking system variables)
    * boots always redboot and leaves booting procedure to redboot if nvram var resetbutton_enable=1
    * add more AR5312 specific code (unused right now), for later AP48 support
    * printf implementation for easier and more compfortable debug output code writing
