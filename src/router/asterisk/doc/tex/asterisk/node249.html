Design Goals</A>
</H1>

<P>
CEL, or Channel Event Logging, has been written with the hopes that it will help
solve some of the problems that were difficult to address in CDR records. Some
difficulties in CDR generation are the fact that the CDR record stores three
events: the "Start" time, the "Answer" time, and the "End" time. Billing time is
usually the difference between "Answer" and "End", and total call duration was
the difference in time from "Start" to "End".  The trouble with this direct and
simple approach is the fact that calls can be transferred, put on hold,
conferenced, forwarded, etc. In general, those doing billing applications in
Asterisk find they have to do all sorts of very creative things to overcome the
shortcomings of CDR records, often supplementing the CDR records with AGI
scripts and manager event filters.

<P>
The fundamental assumption is that the Channel is the fundamental communication
object in asterisk, which basically provides a communication channel between two
communication ports. It makes sense to have an event system aimed at recording
important events on channels. Each event is attached to a channel, like ANSWER
or HANGUP. Some events are meant to connect two or more channels, like the
BRIDGE_START event. Some events, like BLINDTRANSFER, are initiated by one
channel, but affect two others. These events use the Peer field, like BRIDGE
would, to point to the target channel.

<P>
The design philosophy of CEL is to generate event data that can grouped together
to form a billing record. This may not be a simple task, but we hope to provide
a few different examples that could be used as a basis for those involved in
this effort.

<P>
There are definite parallels between Manager events and CEL events, but there
are some differences.  Some events that are generated by CEL are not generated
by the Manager interface (yet). CEL is optimized for databases, and Manager
events are not. The focus of CEL is billing. The Manager interface is targeted
to real-time monitoring and control of asterisk.

<P>
To give the reader a feel for the complexities involved in billing, please take
note of the following sequence of events:

<P>
Remember that 150, 151, and 152 are all Zap extension numbers, and their
respective devices are Zap/50, Zap/51, and Zap/52.

<P>
152 dials 151; 151 answers.  152 parks 151; 152 hangs up.  150 picks up the park
(dials 701).  150 and 151 converse.  151 flashes hook; dials 152, talks to 152,
then 151 flashes hook again for 3-way conference. 151 converses with the other
two for a while, then hangs up. 150 and 152 keep conversing, then hang up. 150
hangs up first.(not that it matters).

<P>
This sequence of actions will generate the following annotated list of 42 CEL
events:

<P>
<I>Note that the actual CEL events below are in CSV format and do not include
     the ;;; and text after that which gives a description of what the event
     represents.</I>
