Glossary of Terms</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this document, we will use some terms which may require
clarification. Most of these terms are specific to Asterisk, and are by
no means standard.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>CCBS: Call Completion on Busy Subscriber. When a call fails because the
recipient's phone is busy, the caller will have the opportunity to
request CCBS. When the recipient's phone is no longer busy, the caller
will be alerted. The means by which the caller is alerted is dependent
upon the type of agent used by the caller.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>CCNR: Call Completion on No Response. When a call fails because the
recipient does not answer the phone, the caller will have the opportun-
ity to request CCNR. When the recipient's phone becomes busy and then
is no longer busy, the caller will be alerted. The means by which the
caller is alerted is dependent upon the type of the agent used by the
caller.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Agent: The agent is the entity within Asterisk that communicates with
and acts on behalf of the calling party.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Monitor: The monitor is the entity within Asterisk that communicates
with and monitors the status of the called party.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Generic Agent: A generic agent is an agent that uses protocol-agnostic
methods to communicate with the caller. Generic agents should only be
used for phones, and never should be used for "trunks."

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Generic Monitor: A generic monitor is a monitor that uses protocol-
agnostic methods to monitor the status of the called party. Like with
generic agents, generic monitors should only be used for phones.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Native Agent: The opposite of a generic agent. A native agent uses
protocol-specific messages to communicate with the calling party.
Native agents may be used for both phones and trunks, but it must be
known ahead of time that the device with which Asterisk is communica-
ting supports the necessary signaling.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Native Monitor: The opposite of a generic monitor. A native monitor
uses protocol-specific messages to subscribe to and receive notifica-
tion of the status of the called party. Native monitors may be used
for both phones and trunks, but it must be known ahead of time that
the device with which Asterisk is communicating supports the
necessary signaling.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Offer: An offer of CC refers to the notification received by the caller
that he may request CC.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Request: When the caller decides that he would like to subscribe to CC,
he will make a request for CC. Furthermore, the term may refer to any
outstanding requests made by callers.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Recall: When the caller attempts to call the recipient after being
alerted that the recipient is available, this action is referred to
as a "recall."
</LI>
</UL>
