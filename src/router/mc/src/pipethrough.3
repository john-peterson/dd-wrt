#include <pipethrough.h>

extern int pipethrough(const     char                  *command,
                       const     struct pipe_inbuffer  *stdin_buf,
                       /*@out@*/ struct pipe_outbuffer *stdout_buf,
                       /*@out@*/ struct pipe_outbuffer *stderr_buf,
                       /*@out@*/ int                   *status);

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The pipethrough function executes the \fIcommand\fR via the shell. The
command's input is the data provided in \fIstdin_buf\fR. The output buffers
\fIstdout_buf\fR and \fIstderr_buf\fR will be filled with the output of the
command. After usage they must be freed using pipe_outbuffer_finalize(3).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, pipethrough returns 0. On failure it returns -1 and sets
\fIerrno\fR to the first error that occurred. Later errors are discarded
silently.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It SHELL
The shell invoked by pipethrough. Defaults to /bin/sh.
