REQUIREMENTS
- GNU gettext (Debian/Ubuntu: gettext package)
- ip (Debian/Ubuntu: iproute package)
- aircrack-ng 1.0 rc2
- WORKING injection capable driver for the interface you want to use

COMPILING:
To install just type "make" in main dir, as root. 
Airoscript is a bash script, so it hasn't got to be compiled, anyway, it has a build dep: gettext.
Airosperl (Airoscript gui) is a perl script, so, it hasnt got to be compiled neither.

NEW FEATURES
Airoscript is fully i10n (currently translated to spanish), configurable , themable and modular. 

PATCHES
If you are running a supported non-standard distro (like wifislax) you should try executing:
make wifislax
that will patch /etc/airoscript.conf with a default config that will work for you.

DEBIAN:
There is a file regarding debian packaging, if you're going to package airoscript for debian.
For normal installations where aircrack-ng is installed by debian package you should use "make debian".

PROBLEMS:
If your system has not aircrack-ng or xterm installed in /usr/bin you should change that paths. 
If something fails when trying to use dhcp, check that you have dhclient installed, if not, just change $DHCPSOFT var on config file for your dhcp client software.
