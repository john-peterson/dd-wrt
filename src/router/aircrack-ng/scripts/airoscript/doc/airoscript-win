First, we'll install cygwin and some dependency:
bash 
xterm
xorg-server
ncurses
x-start-menu-icons
xedit (optional)
tar (optional)

Now, we install aircrack-ng in cygwin's bin directory. (Just copy the .exe and airmon-ng there)
Now we'll install airoscript:
[code]
CD_TO_DIR_WHERE_AIROSCRIPT_TARBALL_IS_UNCOMPRESSED --> just if you don't have installed tar, otherwise, uncompress airoscript with tar -xvf
make
[/code]
:-D Just that.
Ok, note for cd_to_blah... /cygdrives/ is 'windows letter units mountpoint'
Now, we configure aiorscript for using airserv-ng (put WIFI=localhost:666) editing it with xedit (that's because I told to install xedit)

Now we start X server from start menu
Start airserv-ng with commview library for inyection (if supported, note this won't work on most systems)(Even aircrack-ng won't work on some systems/wifi cards)

And now, from cygwin shell we just type: airoscript
NOTE: We'll have to set DISPLAY variable before starting airoscript, use export DISPLAY=:0 or put it on your .bashrc
Oh! And tell airoscript to not put interface in monitor mode ok?
