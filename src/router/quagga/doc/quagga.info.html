1 Overview
**********
</P><P>

Quagga is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based routing
services with routing protocols support such as RIPv1, RIPv2, RIPng,
OSPFv2, OSPFv3, BGP-4, and BGP-4+ (*note Supported RFC::). Quagga also
supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior.  In
addition to traditional IPv4 routing protocols, Quagga also supports
IPv6 routing protocols.  With SNMP daemon which supports SMUX protocol,
Quagga provides routing protocol MIBs (*note SNMP Support::).
</P><P>

   Quagga uses an advanced software architecture to provide you with a
high quality, multi server routing engine. Quagga has an interactive
user interface for each routing protocol and supports common client
commands.  Due to this design, you can add new protocol daemons to
Quagga easily.  You can use Quagga library as your program's client
user interface.
</P><P>

   Quagga is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

1.1 About Quagga
================
</P><P>

Today, TCP/IP networks are covering all of the world.  The Internet has
been deployed in many countries, companies, and to the home.  When you
connect to the Internet your packet will pass many routers which have
TCP/IP routing functionality.
</P><P>

   A system with Quagga installed acts as a dedicated router.  With
Quagga, your machine exchanges routing information with other routers
using routing protocols.  Quagga uses this information to update the
kernel routing table so that the right data goes to the right place.
You can dynamically change the configuration and you may view routing
table information from the Quagga terminal interface.
</P><P>

   Adding to routing protocol support, Quagga can setup interface's
flags, interface's address, static routes and so on.  If you have a
small network, or a stub network, or xDSL connection, configuring the
Quagga routing software is very easy.  The only thing you have to do is
to set up the interfaces and put a few commands about static routes
and/or default routes.  If the network is rather large, or if the
network structure changes frequently, you will want to take advantage
of Quagga's dynamic routing protocol support for protocols such as RIP,
OSPF or BGP.
</P><P>

   Traditionally, UNIX based router configuration is done by `ifconfig'
and `route' commands.  Status of routing table is displayed by
`netstat' utility.  Almost of these commands work only if the user has
root privileges.  Quagga has a different system administration method.
There are two user modes in Quagga.  One is normal mode, the other is
enable mode.  Normal mode user can only view system status, enable mode
user can change system configuration.  This UNIX account independent
feature will be great help to the router administrator.
</P><P>

   Currently, Quagga supports common unicast routing protocols.
Multicast routing protocols such as BGMP, PIM-SM, PIM-DM may be
supported in Quagga 2.0.  MPLS support is going on.  In the future,
TCP/IP filtering control, QoS control, diffserv configuration will be
added to Quagga. Quagga project's final goal is making a productive,
quality, free TCP/IP routing software.

</P><P>

1.2 System Architecture
=======================
</P><P>

Traditional routing software is made as a one process program which
provides all of the routing protocol functionalities.  Quagga takes a
different approach.  It is made from a collection of several daemons
that work together to build the routing table.  There may be several
protocol-specific routing daemons and zebra the kernel routing manager.
</P><P>

   The `ripd' daemon handles the RIP protocol, while `ospfd' is a
daemon which supports OSPF version 2.  `bgpd' supports the BGP-4
protocol.  For changing the kernel routing table and for redistribution
of routes between different routing protocols, there is a kernel
routing table manager `zebra' daemon.  It is easy to add a new routing
protocol daemons to the entire routing system without affecting any
other software.  You need to run only the protocol daemon associated
with routing protocols in use.  Thus, user may run a specific daemon
and send routing reports to a central routing console.
</P><P>

   There is no need for these daemons to be running on the same
machine. You can even run several same protocol daemons on the same
machine.  This architecture creates new possibilities for the routing
system.
</P><P>

     +----+  +----+  +-----+  +-----+
     |bgpd|  |ripd|  |ospfd|  |zebra|
     +----+  +----+  +-----+  +-----+
                                 |
     +---------------------------|--+
     |                           v  |
     |  UNIX Kernel  routing table  |
     |                              |
     +------------------------------+
</P><P>

         Quagga System Architecture
</P><P>

   Multi-process architecture brings extensibility, modularity and
maintainability.  At the same time it also brings many configuration
files and terminal interfaces.  Each daemon has it's own configuration
file and terminal interface.  When you configure a static route, it
must be done in `zebra' configuration file.  When you configure BGP
network it must be done in `bgpd' configuration file.  This can be a
very annoying thing.  To resolve the problem, Quagga provides
integrated user interface shell called `vtysh'.  `vtysh' connects to
each daemon with UNIX domain socket and then works as a proxy for user
input.
</P><P>

   Quagga was planned to use multi-threaded mechanism when it runs with
a kernel that supports multi-threads.  But at the moment, the thread
library which comes with GNU/Linux or FreeBSD has some problems with
running reliable services such as routing software, so we don't use
threads at all.  Instead we use the `select(2)' system call for
multiplexing the events.
</P><P>

</P><P>

1.3 Supported Platforms
=======================
</P><P>

Currently Quagga supports GNU/Linux, BSD and Solaris. Porting Quagga to
other platforms is not too difficult as platform dependent code should
most be limited to the `zebra' daemon.  Protocol daemons are mostly
platform independent. Please let us know when you find out Quagga runs
on a platform which is not listed below.
</P><P>

   The list of officially supported platforms are listed below. Note
that Quagga may run correctly on other platforms, and may run with
partial functionality on further platforms.
</P><P>

   * GNU/Linux 2.2.x and higher
</P><P>

   * FreeBSD 4.x and higher
</P><P>

   * NetBSD 1.6 and higher
</P><P>

   * OpenBSD 2.5 and higher
</P><P>

   * Solaris 2.6 and higher (IPv6 support requires a patch at moment)
</P><P>

   Some IPv6 stacks are in development.  Quagga supports following IPv6
stacks.  For BSD, we recommend KAME IPv6 stack.  Solaris IPv6 stack is
not yet supported.
</P><P>

   * Linux IPv6 stack for GNU/Linux 2.2.x and higher.
</P><P>

   * KAME IPv6 stack for BSD.
</P><P>

   * INRIA IPv6 stack for BSD.

</P><P>

2.1.1 The Configure script and its options
------------------------------------------
</P><P>

Quagga has an excellent configure script which automatically detects
most host configurations.  There are several additional configure
options you can use to turn off IPv6 support, to disable the
compilation of specific daemons, and to enable SNMP support.
</P><P>

`--enable-guile'
     Turn on compilation of the zebra-guile interpreter.  You will need
     the guile library to make this.  zebra-guile implementation is not
     yet finished.  So this option is only useful for zebra-guile
     developers.
</P><P>

`--disable-ipv6'
     Turn off IPv6 related features and daemons.  Quagga configure
     script automatically detects IPv6 stack.  But sometimes you might
     want to disable IPv6 support of Quagga.
</P><P>

`--disable-zebra'
     Do not build zebra daemon.
</P><P>

`--disable-ripd'
     Do not build ripd.
</P><P>

`--disable-ripngd'
     Do not build ripngd.
</P><P>

`--disable-ospfd'
     Do not build ospfd.
</P><P>

`--disable-ospf6d'
     Do not build ospf6d.
</P><P>

`--disable-bgpd'
     Do not build bgpd.
</P><P>

`--disable-bgp-announce'
     Make `bgpd' which does not make bgp announcements at all.  This
     feature is good for using `bgpd' as a BGP announcement listener.
</P><P>

`--enable-netlink'
     Force to enable GNU/Linux netlink interface.  Quagga configure
     script detects netlink interface by checking a header file.  When
     the header file does not match to the current running kernel,
     configure script will not turn on netlink support.
</P><P>

`--enable-snmp'
     Enable SNMP support.  By default, SNMP support is disabled.
</P><P>

`--enable-opaque-lsa'
     Enable support for Opaque LSAs (RFC2370) in ospfd.
</P><P>

`--disable-ospfapi'
     Disable support for OSPF-API, an API to interface directly with
     ospfd.  OSPF-API is enabled if -enable-opaque-lsa is set.
</P><P>

`--disable-ospfclient'
     Disable building of the example OSPF-API client.
</P><P>

`--enable-ospf-te'
     Enable support for OSPF Traffic Engineering Extension
     (internet-draft) this requires support for Opaque LSAs.
</P><P>

`--enable-multipath=ARG'
     Enable support for Equal Cost Multipath. ARG is the maximum number
     of ECMP paths to allow, set to 0 to allow unlimited number of
     paths.
</P><P>

`--enable-rtadv'
     Enable support IPV6 router advertisement in zebra.
</P><P>

   You may specify any combination of the above options to the configure
script.  By default, the executables are placed in `/usr/local/sbin'
and the configuration files in `/usr/local/etc'. The `/usr/local/'
installation prefix and other directories may be changed using the
following options to the configuration script.
</P><P>

`--prefix=PREFIX'
     Install architecture-independent files in PREFIX [/usr/local].
</P><P>

`--sysconfdir=DIR'
     Look for configuration files in DIR [PREFIX/etc]. Note that sample
     configuration files will be installed here.
</P><P>

`--localstatedir=DIR'
     Configure zebra to use DIR for local state files, such as pid
     files and unix sockets.
</P><P>

     % ./configure --disable-ipv6
</P><P>

   This command will configure zebra and the routing daemons.
</P><P>


File: quagga.info,  Node: Least-Privilege support,  Next: Linux notes,  Prev: The Configure script and its options,  Up: Configure the Software
</P><P>

2.1.2 Least-Privilege support
-----------------------------
</P><P>

Additionally, you may configure zebra to drop its elevated privileges
shortly after startup and switch to another user. The configure script
will automatically try to configure this support. There are three
configure options to control the behaviour of Quagga daemons.
</P><P>

`--enable-user=USER'
     Switch to user ARG shortly after startup, and run as user ARG in
     normal operation.
</P><P>

`--enable-group=GROUP'
     Switch real and effective group to GROUP shortly after startup.
</P><P>

`--enable-vty-group=GROUP'
     Create Unix Vty sockets (for use with vtysh) with group owndership
     set to GROUP. This allows one to create a seperate group which is
     restricted to accessing only the Vty sockets, hence allowing one to
     delegate this group to individual users, or to run vtysh setgid to
     this group.
</P><P>

   The default user and group which will be configured is 'quagga' if
no user or group is specified. Note that this user or group requires
write access to the local state directory (see -localstatedir) and
requires at least read access, and write access if you wish to allow
daemons to write out their configuration, to the configuration
directory (see -sysconfdir).
</P><P>

   On systems which have the 'libcap' capabilities manipulation library
(currently only linux), the quagga system will retain only minimal
capabilities required, further it will only raise these capabilities for
brief periods. On systems without libcap, quagga will run as the user
specified and only raise its uid back to uid 0 for brief periods.
</P><P>


File: quagga.info,  Node: Linux notes,  Prev: Least-Privilege support,  Up: Configure the Software
</P><P>

2.1.3 Linux Notes
-----------------
</P><P>

There are several options available only to GNU/Linux systems: (1).  If
you use GNU/Linux, make sure that the current kernel configuration is
what you want.  Quagga will run with any kernel configuration but some
recommendations do exist.
</P><P>

CONFIG_NETLINK
     Kernel/User netlink socket. This is a brand new feature which
     enables an advanced interface between the Linux kernel and zebra
     (*note Kernel Interface::).
</P><P>

CONFIG_RTNETLINK
     Routing messages.  This makes it possible to receive netlink
     routing messages.  If you specify this option, `zebra' can detect
     routing information updates directly from the kernel (*note Kernel
     Interface::).
</P><P>

CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
     IP: multicasting.  This option should be specified when you use
     `ripd' (*note RIP::) or `ospfd' (*note OSPFv2::) because these
     protocols use multicast.
</P><P>

   IPv6 support has been added in GNU/Linux kernel version 2.2.  If you
try to use the Quagga IPv6 feature on a GNU/Linux kernel, please make
sure the following libraries have been installed.  Please note that
these libraries will not be needed when you uses GNU C library 2.1 or
upper.
</P><P>

`inet6-apps'
     The `inet6-apps' package includes basic IPv6 related libraries such
     as `inet_ntop' and `inet_pton'.  Some basic IPv6 programs such as
     `ping', `ftp', and `inetd' are also included. The `inet-apps' can
     be found at `ftp://ftp.inner.net/pub/ipv6/'.
</P><P>

`net-tools'
     The `net-tools' package provides an IPv6 enabled interface and
     routing utility.  It contains `ifconfig', `route', `netstat', and
     other tools.  `net-tools' may be found at
     `http://www.tazenda.demon.co.uk/phil/net-tools/'.

</P><P>

2.2 Build the Software
======================
</P><P>

After configuring the software, you will need to compile it for your
system. Simply issue the command `make' in the root of the source
directory and the software will be compiled. If you have *any* problems
at this stage, be certain to send a bug report *Note Bug Reports::.
</P><P>

     % ./configure
     .
     .
     .
     ./configure output
     .
     .
     .
     % make
</P><P>


File: quagga.info,  Node: Install the Software,  Prev: Build the Software,  Up: Installation
</P><P>

2.3 Install the Software
========================
</P><P>

Installing the software to your system consists of copying the compiled
programs and supporting files to a standard location. After the
installation process has completed, these files have been copied from
your work directory to `/usr/local/bin', and `/usr/local/etc'.
</P><P>

   To install the Quagga suite, issue the following command at your
shell prompt: `make install'.
</P><P>

     %
     % make install
     %
</P><P>

   Quagga daemons have their own terminal interface or VTY.  After
installation, you have to setup each beast's port number to connect to
them.  Please add the following entries to `/etc/services'.
</P><P>

     zebrasrv      2600/tcp		  # zebra service
     zebra         2601/tcp		  # zebra vty
     ripd          2602/tcp		  # RIPd vty
     ripngd        2603/tcp		  # RIPngd vty
     ospfd         2604/tcp		  # OSPFd vty
     bgpd          2605/tcp		  # BGPd vty
     ospf6d        2606/tcp		  # OSPF6d vty
     ospfapi       2607/tcp		  # ospfapi
     isisd         2608/tcp		  # ISISd vty
</P><P>

   If you use a FreeBSD newer than 2.2.8, the above entries are already
added to `/etc/services' so there is no need to add it. If you specify
a port number when starting the daemon, these entries may not be needed.
</P><P>

   You may need to make changes to the config files in
`/etc/quagga/*.conf'. *Note Config Commands::.

3 Basic commands
****************
</P><P>

There are five routing daemons in use, and there is one manager daemon.
These daemons may be located on separate machines from the manager
daemon.  Each of these daemons will listen on a particular port for
incoming VTY connections.  The routing daemons are:
</P><P>

   * `ripd', `ripngd', `ospfd', `ospf6d', `bgpd'
</P><P>

   * `zebra'
</P><P>

   The following sections discuss commands common to all the routing
daemons.
</P><P>

* Menu:
</P><P>

* Terminal Mode Commands::      Common commands used in a VTY
* Config Commands::             Commands used in config files
* Common Invocation Options::   Starting the daemons
* Virtual Terminal Interfaces:: Interacting with the daemons

3.1 Config Commands
===================
</P><P>

* Menu:
</P><P>

* Basic Config Commands::       Some of the generic config commands
* Sample Config File::          An example config file
</P><P>

   In a config file, you can write the debugging options, a vty's
password, routing daemon configurations, a log file name, and so forth.
This information forms the initial command set for a routing beast as
it is starting.
</P><P>

   Config files are generally found in:
</P><P>

     `/etc/quagga/*.conf'
</P><P>

   Each of the daemons has its own config file.  For example, zebra's
default config file name is:
</P><P>

     `/etc/quagga/zebra.conf'
</P><P>

   The daemon name plus `.conf' is the default config file name. You
can specify a config file using the `-f' or `--config-file' options
when starting the daemon.
</P><P>


File: quagga.info,  Node: Basic Config Commands,  Next: Sample Config File,  Up: Config Commands
</P><P>

3.1.1 Basic Config Commands
---------------------------
</P><P>

 -- Command: hostname HOSTNAME
     Set hostname of the router.
</P><P>

 -- Command: password PASSWORD
     Set password for vty interface.  If there is no password, a vty
     won't accept connections.
</P><P>

 -- Command: enable password PASSWORD
     Set enable password.
</P><P>

 -- Command: log trap LEVEL
 -- Command: no log trap
     These commands are deprecated and are present only for historical
     compatibility.  The log trap command sets the current logging
     level for all enabled logging destinations, and it sets the
     default for all future logging commands that do not specify a
     level.  The normal default logging level is debugging.  The `no'
     form of the command resets the default level for future logging
     commands to debugging, but it does not change the logging level of
     existing logging destinations.
</P><P>

 -- Command: log stdout
 -- Command: log stdout LEVEL
 -- Command: no log stdout
     Enable logging output to stdout.  If the optional second argument
     specifying the logging level is not present, the default logging
     level (typically debugging, but can be changed using the
     deprecated `log trap' command) will be used.  The `no' form of the
     command disables logging to stdout.  The `level' argument must
     have one of these values: emergencies, alerts, critical, errors,
     warnings, notifications, informational, or debugging.  Note that
     the existing code logs its most important messages with severity
     `errors'.
</P><P>

 -- Command: log file FILENAME
 -- Command: log file FILENAME LEVEL
 -- Command: no log file
     If you want to log into a file, please specify `filename' as in
     this example:
          log file /var/log/quagga/bgpd.log informational
     If the optional second argument specifying the logging level is
     not present, the default logging level (typically debugging, but
     can be changed using the deprecated `log trap' command) will be
     used.  The `no' form of the command disables logging to a file.
</P><P>

     Note: if you do not configure any file logging, and a daemon
     crashes due to a signal or an assertion failure, it will attempt
     to save the crash information in a file named
     /var/tmp/quagga.&#60;daemon name&#62;.crashlog.  For security reasons,
     this will not happen if the file exists already, so it is
     important to delete the file after reporting the crash information.
</P><P>

 -- Command: log syslog
 -- Command: log syslog LEVEL
 -- Command: no log syslog
     Enable logging output to syslog.  If the optional second argument
     specifying the logging level is not present, the default logging
     level (typically debugging, but can be changed using the
     deprecated `log trap' command) will be used.  The `no' form of the
     command disables logging to syslog.
</P><P>

 -- Command: log monitor
 -- Command: log monitor LEVEL
 -- Command: no log monitor
     Enable logging output to vty terminals that have enabled logging
     using the `terminal monitor' command.  By default, monitor logging
     is enabled at the debugging level, but this command (or the
     deprecated `log trap' command) can be used to change the monitor
     logging level.  If the optional second argument specifying the
     logging level is not present, the default logging level (typically
     debugging, but can be changed using the deprecated `log trap'
     command) will be used.  The `no' form of the command disables
     logging to terminal monitors.
</P><P>

 -- Command: log facility FACILITY
 -- Command: no log facility
     This command changes the facility used in syslog messages.  The
     default facility is `daemon'.  The `no' form of the command resets
     the facility to the default `daemon' facility.
</P><P>

 -- Command: log record-priority
 -- Command: no log record-priority
     To include the severity in all messages logged to a file, to
     stdout, or to a terminal monitor (i.e. anything except syslog),
     use the `log record-priority' global configuration command.  To
     disable this option, use the `no' form of the command.  By default,
     the severity level is not included in logged messages.  Note: some
     versions of syslogd (including Solaris) can be configured to
     include the facility and level in the messages emitted.
</P><P>

 -- Command: service password-encryption
     Encrypt password.
</P><P>

 -- Command: service advanced-vty
     Enable advanced mode VTY.
</P><P>

 -- Command: service terminal-length &#60;0-512&#62;
     Set system wide line configuration.  This configuration command
     applies to all VTY interfaces.
</P><P>

 -- Command: line vty
     Enter vty configuration mode.
</P><P>

 -- Command: banner motd default
     Set default motd string.
</P><P>

 -- Command: no banner motd
     No motd banner string will be printed.
</P><P>

 -- Line Command: exec-timeout MINUTE
 -- Line Command: exec-timeout MINUTE SECOND
     Set VTY connection timeout value.  When only one argument is
     specified it is used for timeout value in minutes.  Optional
     second argument is used for timeout value in seconds. Default
     timeout value is 10 minutes.  When timeout value is zero, it means
     no timeout.
</P><P>

 -- Line Command: no exec-timeout
     Do not perform timeout at all.  This command is as same as
     `exec-timeout 0 0'.
</P><P>

 -- Line Command: access-class ACCESS-LIST
     Restrict vty connections with an access list.
</P><P>

3.1.2 Sample Config File
------------------------
</P><P>

Below is a sample configuration file for the zebra daemon.
</P><P>

     !
     ! Zebra configuration file
     !
     hostname Router
     password zebra
     enable password zebra
     !
     log stdout
     !
     !
</P><P>

   '!' and '#' are comment characters.  If the first character of the
word is one of the comment characters then from the rest of the line
forward will be ignored as a comment.
</P><P>

     password zebra!password
</P><P>

   If a comment character is not the first character of the word, it's a
normal character. So in the above example '!' will not be regarded as a
comment and the password is set to 'zebra!password'.
</P><P>


File: quagga.info,  Node: Terminal Mode Commands,  Next: Config Commands,  Up: Basic commands
</P><P>

3.2 Terminal Mode Commands
==========================
</P><P>

 -- Command: write terminal
     Displays the current configuration to the vty interface.
</P><P>

 -- Command: write file
     Write current configuration to configuration file.
</P><P>

 -- Command: configure terminal
     Change to configuration mode.  This command is the first step to
     configuration.
</P><P>

 -- Command: terminal length &#60;0-512&#62;
     Set terminal display length to &#60;0-512&#62;.  If length is 0, no
     display control is performed.
</P><P>

 -- Command: who
     Show a list of currently connected vty sessions.
</P><P>

 -- Command: list
     List all available commands.
</P><P>

 -- Command: show version
     Show the current version of Quagga and its build host information.
</P><P>

 -- Command: show logging
     Shows the current configuration of the logging system.  This
     includes the status of all logging destinations.
</P><P>

 -- Command: logmsg LEVEL MESSAGE
     Send a message to all logging destinations that are enabled for
     messages of the given severity.
</P><P>


File: quagga.info,  Node: Common Invocation Options,  Next: Virtual Terminal Interfaces,  Prev: Config Commands,  Up: Basic commands
</P><P>

3.3 Common Invocation Options
=============================
</P><P>

These options apply to all Quagga daemons.
</P><P>

`-d'
`--daemon'
     Runs in daemon mode.
</P><P>

`-f FILE'
`--config_file=FILE'
     Set configuration file name.
</P><P>

`-h'
`--help'
     Display this help and exit.
</P><P>

`-i FILE'
`--pid_file=FILE'
     Upon startup the process identifier of the daemon is written to a
     file, typically in `/var/run'.  This file can be used by the init
     system to implement commands such as `.../init.d/zebra status',
     `.../init.d/zebra restart' or `.../init.d/zebra stop'.
</P><P>

     The file name is an run-time option rather than a configure-time
     option so that multiple routing daemons can be run simultaneously.
     This is useful when using Quagga to implement a routing looking
     glass.  One machine can be used to collect differing routing views
     from differing points in the network.
</P><P>

`-A ADDRESS'
`--vty_addr=ADDRESS'
     Set the VTY local address to bind to. If set, the VTY socket will
     only be bound to this address.
</P><P>

`-P PORT'
`--vty_port=PORT'
     Set the VTY TCP port number. If set to 0 then the TCP VTY sockets
     will not be opened.
</P><P>

`-u USER'
`--vty_addr=USER'
     Set the user and group to run as.
</P><P>

`-v'
`--version'
     Print program version.
</P><P>

3.4.1 VTY Overview
------------------
</P><P>

VTY stands for Virtual TeletYpe interface.  It means you can connect to
the daemon via the telnet protocol.
</P><P>

   To enable a VTY interface, you have to setup a VTY password.  If
there is no VTY password, one cannot connect to the VTY interface at
all.

4.3 Static Route Commands
=========================
</P><P>

Static routing is a very fundamental feature of routing technology.  It
defines static prefix and gateway.
</P><P>

 -- Command: ip route NETWORK GATEWAY
     NETWORK is destination prefix with format of A.B.C.D/M.  GATEWAY
     is gateway for the prefix.  When GATEWAY is A.B.C.D format.  It is
     taken as a IPv4 address gateway.  Otherwise it is treated as an
     interface name. If the interface name is NULL0 then zebra installs

   If there is no route to 10.0.0.2 and 10.0.0.3, and interface eth0 is
reachable, then the last route is installed into the kernel.
</P><P>

   If zebra has been compiled with multipath support, and both 10.0.0.2
and 10.0.0.3 are reachable, zebra will install a multipath route via
both nexthops, if the platform supports this.

</P><P>

   This will install a multihop route via the specified next-hops if
they are reachable, as well as a high-metric blackhole route, which can
be useful to prevent traffic destined for a prefix to match
less-specific routes (eg default) should the specified gateways not be
reachable. Eg:

*****
</P><P>

RIP - Routing Information Protocol is widely deployed interior gateway
protocol.  RIP was developed in the 1970s at Xerox Labs as part of the
XNS routing protocol.  RIP is a "distance-vector" protocol and is based
on the "Bellman-Ford" algorithms.  As a distance-vector protocol, RIP
router send updates to its neighbors periodically, thus allowing the
convergence to a known topology.  In each update, the distance to any
given network will be broadcasted to its neighboring router.
</P><P>

   `ripd' supports RIP version 2 as described in RFC2453 and RIP
version 1 as described in RFC1058.

</P><P>

5.1 Starting and Stopping ripd
==============================
</P><P>

The default configuration file name of `ripd"s is `ripd.conf'.  When
invocation `ripd' searches directory /etc/quagga.  If `ripd.conf' is
not there next search current directory.
</P><P>

   RIP uses UDP port 520 to send and receive RIP packets.  So the user
must have the capability to bind the port, generally this means that
the user must have superuser privileges.  RIP protocol requires
interface information maintained by `zebra' daemon.  So running `zebra'
is mandatory to run `ripd'.  Thus minimum sequence for running RIP is
like below:
</P><P>

     # zebra -d
     # ripd -d
</P><P>

   Please note that `zebra' must be invoked before `ripd'.
</P><P>

   To stop `ripd'.  Please use `kill `cat /var/run/ripd.pid`'.  Certain
signals have special meaningss to `ripd'.
</P><P>

`SIGHUP'
     Reload configuration file `ripd.conf'.  All configurations are
     reseted.  All routes learned so far are cleared and removed from
     routing table.
</P><P>

`SIGUSR1'
     Rotate `ripd' logfile.
</P><P>

`SIGINT'
`SIGTERM'
     `ripd' sweeps all installed RIP routes then terminates properly.
</P><P>

   `ripd' invocation options.  Common options that can be specified
(*note Common Invocation Options::).
</P><P>

`-r'

File: quagga.info,  Node: RIP netmask,  Up: Starting and Stopping ripd
</P><P>

5.1.1 RIP netmask
-----------------
</P><P>

The netmask features of `ripd' support both version 1 and version 2 of
RIP.  Version 1 of RIP originally contained no netmask information.  In
RIP version 1, network classes were originally used to determine the
size of the netmask.  Class A networks use 8 bits of mask, Class B
networks use 16 bits of masks, while Class C networks use 24 bits of
mask.  Today, the most widely used method of a network mask is assigned
to the packet on the basis of the interface that received the packet.
Version 2 of RIP supports a variable length subnet mask (VLSM).  By
extending the subnet mask, the mask can be divided and reused.  Each
subnet can be used for different purposes such as large to middle size
LANs and WAN links.  Quagga `ripd' does not support the non-sequential
netmasks that are included in RIP Version 2.
</P><P>

   In a case of similar information with the same prefix and metric, the
old information will be suppressed.  Ripd does not currently support
equal cost multipath routing.
</P><P>

</P><P>

5.2 RIP Configuration
=====================
</P><P>

 -- Command: router rip
     The `router rip' command is necessary to enable RIP.  To disable
     RIP, use the `no router rip' command.  RIP must be enabled before
     carrying out any of the RIP commands.
</P><P>

 -- Command: no router rip
     Disable RIP.
</P><P>

   RIP can be configured to process either Version 1 or Version 2
packets, the default mode is Version 2.  If no version is specified,
then the RIP daemon will default to Version 2.  If RIP is set to Version
1, the setting "Version 1" will be displayed, but the setting "Version
2" will not be displayed whether or not Version 2 is set explicitly as
the version of RIP being used. The version can be specified globally,
and also on a per-interface basis (see below).
</P><P>

 -- RIP Command: version VERSION
     Set RIP process's version.  VERSION can be `1" or `2".
</P><P>

 -- RIP Command: network NETWORK
 -- RIP Command: no network NETWORK
     Set the RIP enable interface by NETWORK.  The interfaces which
     have addresses matching with NETWORK are enabled.
</P><P>

     This group of commands either enables or disables RIP interfaces
     between certain numbers of a specified network address.  For
     example, if the network for 10.0.0.0/24 is RIP enabled, this would
     result in all the addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 being
     enabled for RIP.  The `no network' command will disable RIP for
     the specified network.
</P><P>

 -- RIP Command: network IFNAME
 -- RIP Command: no network IFNAME
     Set a RIP enabled interface by IFNAME.  Both the sending and
     receiving of RIP packets will be enabled on the port specified in
     the `network ifname' command.  The `no network ifname' command
     will disable RIP on the specified interface.
</P><P>

 -- RIP Command: neighbor A.B.C.D
 -- RIP Command: no neighbor A.B.C.D
     Specify RIP neighbor.  When a neighbor doesn't understand
     multicast, this command is used to specify neighbors.  In some
     cases, not all routers will be able to understand multicasting,
     where packets are sent to a network or a group of addresses.  In a
     situation where a neighbor cannot process multicast packets, it is
     necessary to establish a direct link between routers.  The
     neighbor command allows the network administrator to specify a
     router as a RIP neighbor.  The `no neighbor a.b.c.d' command will
     disable the RIP neighbor.
</P><P>

   Below is very simple RIP configuration.  Interface `eth0' and
interface which address match to `10.0.0.0/8' are RIP enabled.
</P><P>

     !
     router rip
      network 10.0.0.0/8
      network eth0
     !
</P><P>

   Passive interface
</P><P>

 -- RIP command: passive-interface (IFNAME|default)
 -- RIP command: no passive-interface IFNAME
     This command sets the specified interface to passive mode.  On
     passive mode interface, all receiving packets are processed as
     normal and ripd does not send either multicast or unicast RIP
     packets except to RIP neighbors specified with `neighbor' command.
     The interface may be specified as DEFAULT to make ripd default to
     passive on all interfaces.
</P><P>

     The default is to be passive on all interfaces.
</P><P>

   RIP version handling
</P><P>

 -- Interface command: ip rip send version VERSION
     VERSION can be `1', `2', `1 2'.  This configuration command
     overrides the router's rip version setting.  The command will
     enable the selected interface to send packets with RIP Version 1,
     RIP Version 2, or both.  In the case of '1 2', packets will be
     both broadcast and multicast.
</P><P>

     The default is to send only version 2.
</P><P>

 -- Interface command: ip rip receive version VERSION
     Version setting for incoming RIP packets.  This command will
     enable the selected interface to receive packets in RIP Version 1,
     RIP Version 2, or both.
</P><P>

     The default is to receive both versions.
</P><P>

   RIP split-horizon
</P><P>

 -- Interface command: ip split-horizon
 -- Interface command: no ip split-horizon
     Control split-horizon on the interface.  Default is `ip
     split-horizon'.  If you don't perform split-horizon on the
     interface, please specify `no ip split-horizon'.

     disables the routes.
</P><P>

 -- RIP command: redistribute static
 -- RIP command: redistribute static metric &#60;0-16&#62;
 -- RIP command: redistribute static route-map ROUTE-MAP

     disables the routes.
</P><P>

 -- RIP command: redistribute connected
 -- RIP command: redistribute connected metric &#60;0-16&#62;
 -- RIP command: redistribute connected route-map ROUTE-MAP
 -- RIP command: no redistribute connected
     Redistribute connected routes into the RIP tables.  `no
     redistribute connected' disables the connected routes in the RIP
     tables.  This command redistribute connected of the interface
     which RIP disabled.  The connected route on RIP enabled interface
     is announced by default.
</P><P>

 -- RIP command: redistribute ospf
 -- RIP command: redistribute ospf metric &#60;0-16&#62;
 -- RIP command: redistribute ospf route-map ROUTE-MAP
 -- RIP command: no redistribute ospf
     `redistribute ospf' redistributes routing information from ospf
     route entries into the RIP tables. `no redistribute ospf' disables
     the routes.
</P><P>

 -- RIP command: redistribute bgp
 -- RIP command: redistribute bgp metric &#60;0-16&#62;
 -- RIP command: redistribute bgp route-map ROUTE-MAP
 -- RIP command: no redistribute bgp
     `redistribute bgp' redistributes routing information from bgp
     route entries into the RIP tables. `no redistribute bgp' disables
     the routes.
</P><P>

   If you want to specify RIP only static routes:
</P><P>

 -- RIP command: default-information originate
</P><P>

 -- RIP command: route A.B.C.D/M
 -- RIP command: no route A.B.C.D/M
     This command is specific to Quagga.  The `route' command makes a
     static route only inside RIP. This command should be used only by
     advanced users who are particularly knowledgeable about the RIP
     protocol.  In most cases, we recommend creating a static route in
     Quagga and redistributing it in RIP using `redistribute static'.

</P><P>

5.4 Filtering RIP Routes
========================
</P><P>

RIP routes can be filtered by a distribute-list.
</P><P>

 -- Command: distribute-list ACCESS_LIST DIRECT IFNAME
     You can apply access lists to the interface with a
     `distribute-list' command.  ACCESS_LIST is the access list name.
     DIRECT is `in' or `out'.  If DIRECT is `in' the access list is
     applied to input packets.
</P><P>

     The `distribute-list' command can be used to filter the RIP path.
     `distribute-list' can apply access-lists to a chosen interface.
     First, one should specify the access-list.  Next, the name of the
     access-list is used in the distribute-list command.  For example,
     in the following configuration `eth0' will permit only the paths
     that match the route 10.0.0.0/8
</P><P>

          !
          router rip
           distribute-list private in eth0
          !
          access-list private permit 10 10.0.0.0/8
          access-list private deny any
          !
</P><P>

   `distribute-list' can be applied to both incoming and outgoing data.
</P><P>

 -- Command: distribute-list prefix PREFIX_LIST (in|out) IFNAME
     You can apply prefix lists to the interface with a
     `distribute-list' command.  PREFIX_LIST is the prefix list name.
     Next is the direction of `in' or `out'.  If DIRECT is `in' the
     access list is applied to input packets.

5.5 RIP Metric Manipulation
===========================
</P><P>

RIP metric is a value for distance for the network.  Usually `ripd'
increment the metric when the network information is received.
Redistributed routes' metric is set to 1.
</P><P>

 -- RIP command: default-metric &#60;1-16&#62;
 -- RIP command: no default-metric &#60;1-16&#62;
     This command modifies the default metric value for redistributed
     routes.  The default value is 1.  This command does not affect
     connected route even if it is redistributed by `redistribute
     connected'.  To modify connected route's metric value, please use
     `redistribute connected metric' or `route-map'.  `offset-list' also
     affects connected routes.

5.7 RIP route-map
=================
</P><P>

Usage of `ripd"s route-map support.
</P><P>

   Optional argument route-map MAP_NAME can be added to each
`redistribute' statement.
</P><P>

     redistribute static [route-map MAP_NAME]
     redistribute connected [route-map MAP_NAME]
     .....
</P><P>

   Cisco applies route-map _before_ routes will exported to rip route
table.  In current Quagga's test implementation, `ripd' applies
route-map after routes are listed in the route table and before routes
will be announced to an interface (something like output filter). I
think it is not so clear, but it is draft and it may be changed at
future.
</P><P>

   Route-map statement (*note Route Map::) is needed to use route-map
functionality.
</P><P>

 -- Route Map: match interface WORD
     This command match to incoming interface.  Notation of this match
     is different from Cisco. Cisco uses a list of interfaces - NAME1
     NAME2 ... NAMEN.  Ripd allows only one name (maybe will change in
     the future).  Next - Cisco means interface which includes next-hop
     of routes (it is somewhat similar to "ip next-hop" statement).
     Ripd means interface where this route will be sent. This
     difference is because "next-hop" of same routes which sends to
     different interfaces must be different. Maybe it'd be better to
     made new matches - say "match interface-out NAME" or something
     like that.
</P><P>

 -- Route Map: match ip address WORD
 -- Route Map: match ip address prefix-list WORD
     Match if route destination is permitted by access-list.
</P><P>

 -- Route Map: match ip next-hop A.B.C.D
     Cisco uses here &#60;access-list&#62;, `ripd' IPv4 address. Match if route
     has this next-hop (meaning next-hop listed in the rip route table
     - "show ip rip")
</P><P>

 -- Route Map: match metric &#60;0-4294967295&#62;
     This command match to the metric value of RIP updates.  For other
     protocol compatibility metric range is shown as &#60;0-4294967295&#62;.
     But for RIP protocol only the value range &#60;0-16&#62; make sense.
</P><P>

 -- Route Map: set ip next-hop A.B.C.D
     This command set next hop value in RIPv2 protocol.  This command
     does not affect RIPv1 because there is no next hop field in the
     packet.
</P><P>

 -- Route Map: set metric &#60;0-4294967295&#62;
     Set a metric for matched route when sending announcement.  The
     metric value range is very large for compatibility with other
     protocols.  For RIP, valid metric values are from 1 to 16.

     The default settings for the timers are as follows:
</P><P>

        * The update timer is 30 seconds. Every update timer seconds,
          the RIP process is awakened to send an unsolicited Response
          message containing the complete routing table to all
          neighboring RIP routers.
</P><P>

        * The timeout timer is 180 seconds. Upon expiration of the
          timeout, the route is no longer valid; however, it is
          retained in the routing table for a short time so that

********
</P><P>

OSPF version 2 is a routing protocol which described in RFC2328 - `OSPF
Version 2'.  OSPF is IGP (Interior Gateway Protocols).  Compared with
RIP, OSPF can provide scalable network support and faster convergence
time.  OSPF is widely used in large networks such as ISP backbone and
enterprise networks.

     draft-ietf-ospf-shortcut-abr-02.txt Quote: "Though the definition
     of the Area Border Router (ABR) in the OSPF specification does not
     require a router with multiple attached areas to have a backbone
     connection, it is actually necessary to provide successful routing
     to the inter-area and external destinations. If this requirement
     is not met, all traffic destined for the areas not connected to
     such an ABR or out of the OSPF domain, is dropped.  This document
     describes alternative ABR behaviors implemented in Cisco and IBM
     routers."

 -- OSPF Command: ospf rfc1583compatibility
 -- OSPF Command: no ospf rfc1583compatibility
     This rfc2328, the sucessor to rfc1583, suggests according to
     section G.2 (changes) in section 16.4 a change to the path
     preference algorithm that prevents possible routing loops that
     were possible in the old version of OSPFv2. More specifically it
     demands that inter-area paths and intra-area path are now of equal
     preference but still both preferred to external paths.

     This command specifies the OSPF enabled interface(s).  If the
     interface has an address from range 192.168.1.0/24 then the
     command below enables ospf on this interface so router can provide
     network information to the other ospf routers via this interface.
          router ospf
           network 192.168.1.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
     Prefix length in interface must be equal or bigger (ie.
     smaller network) than prefix length in network statement. For
     example statement above doesn't enable ospf on interface with
     address 192.168.1.1/23, but it does on interface with address
     192.168.1.129/25.

     reestabish adjacencies with its neighbours after restarts/reboots.
     The host should have system time be set at boot from an external
     source (eg battery backed clock, NTP, etc.) or else the system

Default configuration file of `bgpd' is `bgpd.conf'.  `bgpd' searches
the current directory first then /etc/quagga/bgpd.conf.  All of bgpd's
command must be configured in `bgpd.conf'.
</P><P>

   `bgpd' specific invocation options are described below.  Common
options may also be specified (*note Common Invocation Options::).

9.2 BGP router
==============
</P><P>

First of all you must configure BGP router with `router bgp' command.
To configure BGP router, you need AS number.  AS number is an
identification of autonomous system.  BGP protocol uses the AS number
for detecting whether the BGP connection is internal one or external
one.
</P><P>

 -- Command: router bgp ASN
     Enable a BGP protocol process with the specified ASN.  After this
     statement you can input any `BGP Commands'.  You can not create
     different BGP process under different ASN without specifying
     `multiple-instance' (*note Multiple instance::).
</P><P>

 -- Command: no router bgp ASN
     Destroy a BGP protocol process with the specified ASN.
</P><P>

 -- BGP: bgp router-id A.B.C.D
     This command specifies the router-ID.  If `bgpd' connects to
     `zebra' it gets interface and address information.  In that case
     default router ID value is selected as the largest IP Address of
     the interfaces.  When `router zebra' is not enabled `bgpd' can't
     get interface information so `router-id' is set to 0.0.0.0.  So
     please set router-id by hand.

describes how to use AS.
</P><P>

   AS number is tow octet digita value.  So the value range is from 1

</P><P>

AS path regular expression can be used for displaying BGP routes and AS
path access list.  AS path regular expression is based on `POSIX
1003.2' regular expressions.  Following description is just a subset of
`POSIX' regular expression.  User can use full `POSIX' regular
expression.  Adding to that special character '_' is added for AS path
regular expression.
</P><P>

`.'
     Matches any single character.
</P><P>

`*'
     Matches 0 or more occurrences of pattern.
</P><P>

`+'
     Matches 1 or more occurrences of pattern.
</P><P>

`?'
     Match 0 or 1 occurrences of pattern.

`^'
     Matches the beginning of the line.
</P><P>

`$'
     Matches the end of the line.
</P><P>

`_'
     Character `_' has special meanings in AS path regular expression.
     It matches to space and comma , and AS set delimiter { and } and AS
     confederation delimiter `(' and `)'.  And it also matches to the
     beginning of the line and the end of the line.  So `_' can be used
     for AS value boundaries match.  `show ip bgp regexp _7675_'
     matches to all of BGP routes which as AS number include 7675.

9.8 BGP Communities Attribute
=============================
</P><P>

BGP communities attribute is widely used for implementing policy
routing.  Network operators can manipulate BGP communities attribute
based on their network policy.  BGP communities attribute is defined in
`RFC1997' - `BGP Communities Attribute' and `RFC1998' - `An Application
of the BGP Community Attribute in Multi-home Routing'.  It is an
optional transitive attribute, therefore local policy can travel
through different autonomous system.
</P><P>

   Communities attribute is a set of communities values.  Each
communities value is 4 octet long.  The following format is used to
define communities value.
</P><P>

`AS:VAL'
     This format represents 4 octet communities value.  `AS' is high
     order 2 octet in digit format.  `VAL' is low order 2 octet in
     digit format.  This format is useful to define AS oriented policy
     value.  For example, `7675:80' can be used when AS 7675 wants to
     pass local policy value 80 to neighboring peer.
</P><P>

`internet'
     `internet' represents well-known communities value 0.
</P><P>

`no-export'
     `no-export' represents well-known communities value `NO_EXPORT'
     (0xFFFFFF01).  All routes carry this value must not be advertised
     to outside a BGP confederation boundary.  If neighboring BGP peer
     is part of BGP confederation, the peer is considered as inside a
     BGP confederation boundary, so the route will be announced to the
     peer.
</P><P>

`no-advertise'
     `no-advertise' represents well-known communities value
     `NO_ADVERTISE'
     (0xFFFFFF02).  All routes carry this value must not be advertise
     to other BGP peers.
</P><P>

`local-AS'
     `local-AS' represents well-known communities value
     `NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED' (0xFFFFFF03).  All routes carry this value

9.8.1 BGP Community Lists
-------------------------
</P><P>

BGP community list is a user defined BGP communites attribute list.
BGP community list can be used for matching or manipulating BGP
communities attribute in updates.
</P><P>

   There are two types of community list.  One is standard community
list and another is expanded community list.  Standard community list
defines communities attribute.  Expanded community list defines
communities attribute string with regular expression.  Standard
community list is compiled into binary format when user define it.
Standard community list will be directly compared to BGP communities
attribute in BGP updates.  Therefore the comparison is faster than
expanded community list.
</P><P>

 -- Command: ip community-list standard NAME {permit|deny} COMMUNITY
     This command defines a new standard community list.  COMMUNITY is
     communities value.  The COMMUNITY is compiled into community
     structure.  We can define multiple community list under same name.
     In that case match will happen user defined order.  Once the
     community list matches to communities attribute in BGP updates it
     return permit or deny by the community list definition.  When
     there is no matched entry, deny will be returned.  When COMMUNITY
     is empty it matches to any routes.
</P><P>

 -- Command: ip community-list expanded NAME {permit|deny} LINE
     This command defines a new expanded community list.  LINE is a
     string expression of communities attribute.  LINE can include
     regular expression to match communities attribute in BGP updates.
</P><P>

 -- Command: no ip community-list NAME
 -- Command: no ip community-list standard NAME
 -- Command: no ip community-list expanded NAME
     These commands delete community lists specified by NAME.  All of
     community lists shares a single name space.  So community lists
     can be removed simpley specifying community lists name.
</P><P>

 -- Command: show ip community-list
 -- Command: show ip community-list NAME
     This command display current community list information.  When
     NAME is specified the specified community list's information is
     shown.
</P><P>

9.8.2 Numbered BGP Community Lists
----------------------------------
</P><P>

When number is used for BGP community list name, the number has special
meanings.  Community list number in the range from 1 and 99 is standard
community list.  Community list number in the range from 100 to 199 is
expanded community list.  These community lists are called as numbered
community lists.  On the other hand normal community lists is called as
named community lists.
</P><P>

 -- Command: ip community-list &#60;1-99&#62; {permit|deny} COMMUNITY
     This command defines a new community list.  &#60;1-99&#62; is standard
     community list number.  Community list name within this range
     defines standard community list.  When COMMUNITY is empty it
     matches to any routes.
</P><P>

 -- Command: ip community-list &#60;100-199&#62; {permit|deny} COMMUNITY
     This command defines a new community list.  &#60;100-199&#62; is expanded
     community list number.  Community list name within this range
     defines expanded community list.
</P><P>

 -- Command: ip community-list NAME {permit|deny} COMMUNITY
     When community list type is not specifed, the community list type
     is automatically detected.  If COMMUNITY can be compiled into
     communities attribute, the community list is defined as a standard
     community list.  Otherwise it is defined as an expanded community
     list.  This feature is left for backward compability.  Use of this
     feature is not recommended.

9.8.3 BGP Community in Route Map
--------------------------------
</P><P>

In Route Map (*note Route Map::), we can match or set BGP communities
attribute.  Using this feature network operator can implement their
network policy based on BGP communities attribute.
</P><P>

   Following commands can be used in Route Map.
</P><P>

 -- Route Map: match community WORD
 -- Route Map: match community WORD exact-match
     This command perform match to BGP updates using community list
     WORD.  When the one of BGP communities value match to the one of
     communities value in community list, it is match.  When
     `exact-match' keyword is spcified, match happen only when BGP
     updates have completely same communities value specified in the
     community list.
</P><P>

 -- Route Map: set community none
 -- Route Map: set community COMMUNITY
 -- Route Map: set community COMMUNITY additive
     This command manipulate communities value in BGP updates.  When
     `none' is specified as communities value, it removes entire
     communities attribute from BGP updates.  When COMMUNITY is not
     `none', specified communities value is set to BGP updates.  If BGP
     updates already has BGP communities value, the existing BGP
     communities value is replaced with specified COMMUNITY value.
     When `additive' keyword is specified, COMMUNITY is appended to the
     existing communities value.
</P><P>

 -- Route Map: set comm-list WORD delete
     This command remove communities value from BGP communities
     attribute.  The WORD is community list name.  When BGP route's
     communities value matches to the community list WORD, the
     communities value is removed.  When all of communities value is
     removed eventually, the BGP update's communities attribute is
     completely removed.

9.8.4 Display BGP Routes by Community
-------------------------------------
</P><P>

To show BGP routes which has specific BGP communities attribute, `show
ip bgp' command can be used.  The COMMUNITY value and community list
can be used for `show ip bgp' command.
</P><P>

 -- Command: show ip bgp community
 -- Command: show ip bgp community COMMUNITY
 -- Command: show ip bgp community COMMUNITY exact-match
     `show ip bgp community' displays BGP routes which has communities
     attribute.  When COMMUNITY is specified, BGP routes that matches
     COMMUNITY value is displayed.  For this command, `internet'
     keyword can't be used for COMMUNITY value.  When `exact-match' is
     specified, it display only routes that have an exact match.
</P><P>

 -- Command: show ip bgp community-list WORD
 -- Command: show ip bgp community-list WORD exact-match

9.8.5 Using BGP Communities Attribute
-------------------------------------
</P><P>

Following configuration is the most typical usage of BGP communities
attribute.  AS 7675 provides upstream Internet connection to AS 100.
When following configuration exists in AS 7675, AS 100 networks
operator can set local preference in AS 7675 network by setting BGP
communities attribute to the updates.
</P><P>

     router bgp 7675
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
     !
     ip community-list 70 permit 7675:70
     ip community-list 70 deny
     ip community-list 80 permit 7675:80
     ip community-list 80 deny
     ip community-list 90 permit 7675:90
     ip community-list 90 deny
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 10
      match community 70
      set local-preference 70
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 20
      match community 80
      set local-preference 80
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 30
      match community 90
      set local-preference 90
</P><P>

   Following configuration announce 10.0.0.0/8 from AS 100 to AS 7675.
The route has communities value 7675:80 so when above configuration
exists in AS 7675, announced route's local preference will be set to
value 80.
</P><P>

     router bgp 100
      network 10.0.0.0/8
      neighbor 192.168.0.2 remote-as 7675
      neighbor 192.168.0.2 route-map RMAP out
     !
     ip prefix-list PLIST permit 10.0.0.0/8
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 10
      match ip address prefix-list PLIST
      set community 7675:80
</P><P>

   Following configuration is an example of BGP route filtering using
communities attribute.  This configuration only permit BGP routes which
has BGP communities value 0:80 or 0:90.  Network operator can put
special internal communities value at BGP border router, then limit the
BGP routes announcement into the internal network.
</P><P>

     router bgp 7675
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
     !
     ip community-list 1 permit 0:80 0:90
     !
     route-map RMAP permit in
      match community 1
</P><P>

   Following exmaple filter BGP routes which has communities value 1:1.
When there is no match community-list returns deny.  To avoid filtering
all of routes, we need to define permit any at last.
</P><P>

     router bgp 7675
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
     !
     ip community-list standard FILTER deny 1:1
     ip community-list standard FILTER permit
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 10
      match community FILTER
</P><P>

   Communities value keyword `internet' has special meanings in
standard community lists.  In below example `internet' act as match
any.  It matches all of BGP routes even if the route does not have
communities attribute at all.  So community list `INTERNET' is same as
above example's `FILTER'.
</P><P>

     ip community-list standard INTERNET deny 1:1
     ip community-list standard INTERNET permit internet
</P><P>

   Following configuration is an example of communities value deletion.
With this configuration communities value 100:1 and 100:2 is removed
from BGP updates.  For communities value deletion, only `permit'
community-list is used.  `deny' community-list is ignored.
</P><P>

     router bgp 7675
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
     !
     ip community-list standard DEL permit 100:1 100:2
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 10
      set comm-list DEL delete

9.9 BGP Extended Communities Attribute
======================================
</P><P>

BGP extended communities attribute is introduced with MPLS VPN/BGP
technology.  MPLS VPN/BGP expands capability of network infrastructure
to provide VPN functionality.  At the same time it requires a new
framework for policy routing.  With BGP Extended Communities Attribute
we can use Route Target or Site of Origin for implementing network
policy for MPLS VPN/BGP.
</P><P>

   BGP Extended Communities Attribute is similar to BGP Communities
Attribute.  It is an optional transitive attribute.  BGP Extended
Communities Attribute can carry multiple Extended Community value.
Each Extended Community value is eight octet length.
</P><P>

   BGP Extended Communities Attribute provides an extended range
compared with BGP Communities Attribute.  Adding to that there is a
type field in each value to provides community space structure.
</P><P>

   There are two format to define Extended Community value.  One is AS
based format the other is IP address based format.
</P><P>

`AS:VAL'
     This is a format to define AS based Extended Community value.
     `AS' part is 2 octets Global Administrator subfield in Extended
     Community value.  `VAL' part is 4 octets Local Administrator
     subfield.  `7675:100' represents AS 7675 policy value 100.
</P><P>

`IP-Address:VAL'
     This is a format to define IP address based Extended Community
     value.  `IP-Address' part is 4 octets Global Administrator
     subfield.  `VAL' part is 2 octets Local Administrator subfield.
     `10.0.0.1:100' represents

     multiple extcommunity-list under same name.  In that case match
     will happen user defined order.  Once the extcommunity-list
     matches to extended communities attribute in BGP updates it return
     permit or deny based upon the extcommunity-list definition.  When

9.11 Capability Negotiation
===========================
</P><P>

When adding IPv6 routing information exchange feature to BGP.  There
were some proposals.  IETF IDR working group finally take a proposal
called Multiprotocol Extension for BGP.  The specification is described
in RFC2283.  The protocol does not define new protocols.  It defines
new attributes to existing BGP.  When it is used exchanging IPv6
routing information it is called BGP-4+.  When it is used for
exchanging multicast routing information it is called MBGP.
</P><P>

   `bgpd' supports Multiprotocol Extension for BGP.  So if remote peer
supports the protocol, `bgpd' can exchange IPv6 and/or multicast routing
information.
</P><P>

   Traditional BGP does not have the feature to detect remote peer's
capability whether it can handle other than IPv4 unicast routes.  This
is a big problem using Multiprotocol Extension for BGP to operational
network.  `draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-cap-neg-04.txt' is proposing a feature
called Capability Negotiation.  `bgpd' use this Capability Negotiation
to detect remote peer's capabilities.  If the peer is only configured
as IPv4 unicast neighbor, `bgpd' does not send these Capability
Negotiation packets.
</P><P>

   By default, Quagga will bring up peering with minimal common
capability for the both sides.  For example, local router has unicast
and multicast capabilitie and remote router has unicast capability.  In
this case, the local router will establish the connection with unicast
only capability.  When there are no common capabilities, Quagga sends
Unsupported Capability error and then resets the connection.
</P><P>

   If you want to completely match capabilities with remote peer.
Please use `strict-capability-match' command.
</P><P>

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER strict-capability-match
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER strict-capability-match
     Strictly compares remote capabilities and local capabilities.  If
     capabilities are different, send Unsupported Capability error then
     reset connection.
</P><P>

   You may want to disable sending Capability Negotiation OPEN message
optional parameter to the peer when remote peer does not implement
Capability Negotiation.  Please use `dont-capability-negotiate' command
to disable the feature.
</P><P>

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER dont-capability-negotiate
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER dont-capability-negotiate
     Suppress sending Capability Negotiation as OPEN message optional
     parameter to the peer.  This command only affects the peer is
     configured other than IPv4 unicast configuration.
</P><P>

   When remote peer does not have capability negotiation feature, remote
peer will not send any capabilities at all.  In that case, bgp
configures the peer with configured capabilities.
</P><P>

   You may prefer locally configured capabilities more than the
negotiated capabilities even though remote peer sends capabilities.  If
the peer is configured by `override-capability', `bgpd' ignores received
capabilities then override negotiated capabilities with configured
values.
</P><P>

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER override-capability
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER override-capability
     Override the result of Capability Negotiation with local
     configuration.  Ignore remote peer's capability value.

9.13 Route Server
=================
</P><P>

At an Internet Exchange point, many ISPs are connected to each other by
external BGP peering.  Normally these external BGP connection are done
by `full mesh' method.  As with internal BGP full mesh formation, this
method has a scaling problem.
</P><P>

   This scaling problem is well known.  Route Server is a method to
resolve the problem.  Each ISP's BGP router only peers to Route Server.
Route Server serves as BGP information exchange to other BGP routers.
By applying this method, numbers of BGP connections is reduced from
O(n*(n-1)/2) to O(n).
</P><P>

   Unlike normal BGP router, Route Server must have several routing
tables for managing different routing policies for each BGP speaker.
We call the routing tables as different `view's.  `bgpd' can work as
normal BGP router or Route Server or both at the same time.

9.13.1 Multiple instance
------------------------
</P><P>

To enable multiple view function of `bgpd', you must turn on multiple
instance feature beforehand.
</P><P>

 -- Command: bgp multiple-instance
     Enable BGP multiple instance feature.  After this feature is
     enabled, you can make multiple BGP instances or multiple BGP views.
</P><P>

 -- Command: no bgp multiple-instance
     Disable BGP multiple instance feature.  You can not disable this
     feature when BGP multiple instances or views exist.

</P><P>

 -- Command: bgp config-type cisco

   Community attribute handling is also different.  If there is no
configuration is specified community attribute and extended community
attribute are sent to neighbor.  When user manually disable the feature
community attribute is not sent to the neighbor.  In case of "bgp

----------------------------
</P><P>

BGP instance is a normal BGP process.  The result of route selection
goes to the kernel routing table.  You can setup different AS at the
same time when BGP multiple instance feature is enabled.
</P><P>

 -- Command: router bgp AS-NUMBER
     Make a new BGP instance.  You can use arbitrary word for the NAME.
</P><P>

     bgp multiple-instance

     router bgp 2
      neighbor 10.0.0.3 remote-as 4
      neighbor 10.0.0.4 remote-as 5
</P><P>

   BGP view is almost same as normal BGP process. The result of route
selection does not go to the kernel routing table.  BGP view is only
for exchanging BGP routing information.
</P><P>

 -- Command: router bgp AS-NUMBER view NAME
     Make a new BGP view.  You can use arbitrary word for the NAME.
     This view's route selection result does not go to the kernel
     routing table.
</P><P>

   With this command, you can setup Route Server like below.
</P><P>

     bgp multiple-instance
     !

9.13.3 Routing policy
---------------------
</P><P>

You can set different routing policy for a peer.  For example, you can
set different filter for a peer.
</P><P>

     bgp multiple-instance
     !
     router bgp 1 view 1

      neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 2
      neighbor 10.0.0.1 distribute-list 2 in
</P><P>

   This means BGP update from a peer 10.0.0.1 goes to both BGP view 1
and view 2.  When the update is inserted into view 1, distribute-list 1
is applied.  On the other hand, when the update is inserted into view 2,
distribute-list 2 is applied.

10 Configuring Quagga as a Route Server
***************************************
</P><P>

The purpose of a Route Server is to centralize the peerings between BGP
speakers. For example if we have an exchange point scenario with four
BGP speakers, each of which maintaining a BGP peering with the other
three (*note fig:full-mesh::), we can convert it into a centralized
scenario where each of the four establishes a single BGP peering
against the Route Server (*note fig:route-server::).
</P><P>

   We will first describe briefly the Route Server model implemented by
Quagga.  We will explain the commands that have been added for
configuring that model. And finally we will show a full example of
Quagga configured as Route Server.

</P><P>

10.1 Description of the Route Server model
==========================================
</P><P>

First we are going to describe the normal processing that BGP
announcements suffer inside a standard BGP speaker, as shown in *Note
fig:normal-processing::, it consists of three steps:
</P><P>

   * When an announcement is received from some peer, the `In' filters
     configured for that peer are applied to the announcement. These
     filters can reject the announcement, accept it unmodified, or
     accept it with some of its attributes modified.
</P><P>

   * The announcements that pass the `In' filters go into the Best Path
     Selection process, where they are compared to other announcements
     referred to the same destination that have been received from
     different peers (in case such other announcements exist). For each
     different destination, the announcement which is selected as the
     best is inserted into the BGP speaker's Loc-RIB.
</P><P>

   * The routes which are inserted in the Loc-RIB are considered for
     announcement to all the peers (except the one from which the route
     came). This is done by passing the routes in the Loc-RIB through
     the `Out' filters corresponding to each peer. These filters can
     reject the route, accept it unmodified, or accept it with some of
     its attributes modified. Those routes which are accepted by the
     `Out' filters of a peer are announced to that peer.
</P><P>

 Figure 10.1: Announcement processing inside a "normal" BGP speaker
</P><P>

 Figure 10.2: Full Mesh
</P><P>

 Figure 10.3: Route Server and clients
</P><P>

   Of course we want that the routing tables obtained in each of the
routers are the same when using the route server than when not. But as
a consequence of having a single BGP peering (against the route
server), the BGP speakers can no longer distinguish from/to which peer
each announce comes/goes.  This means that the routers connected to the
route server are not able to apply by themselves the same input/output
filters as in the full mesh scenario, so they have to delegate those
functions to the route server.
</P><P>

   Even more, the "best path" selection must be also performed inside
the route server on behalf of its clients. The reason is that if, after
applying the filters of the announcer and the (potential) receiver, the
route server decides to send to some client two or more different
announcements referred to the same destination, the client will only
retain the last one, considering it as an implicit withdrawal of the
previous announcements for the same destination. This is the expected
behavior of a BGP speaker as defined in `RFC1771', and even though
there are some proposals of mechanisms that permit multiple paths for
the same destination to be sent through a single BGP peering, none of
them are currently supported by most of the existing BGP
implementations.
</P><P>

   As a consequence a route server must maintain additional information
and perform additional tasks for a RS-client that those necessary for
common BGP peerings. Essentially a route server must:
</P><P>

   * Maintain a separated Routing Information Base (Loc-RIB) for each
     peer configured as RS-client, containing the routes selected as a
     result of the "Best Path Selection" process that is performed on
     behalf of that RS-client.
</P><P>

   * Whenever it receives an announcement from a RS-client, it must
     consider it for the Loc-RIBs of the other RS-clients.
</P><P>

        * This means that for each of them the route server must pass
          the announcement through the appropriate `Out' filter of the
          announcer.
</P><P>

        * Then through the  appropriate `In' filter of the potential
          receiver.
</P><P>

        * Only if the announcement is accepted by both filters it will
          be passed to the "Best Path Selection" process.
</P><P>

        * Finally, it might go into the Loc-RIB of the receiver.
</P><P>

   When we talk about the "appropriate" filter, both the announcer and
the receiver of the route must be taken into account. Suppose that the
route server receives an announcement from client A, and the route
server is considering it for the Loc-RIB of client B. The filters that
should be applied are the same that would be used in the full mesh
scenario, i.e., first the `Out' filter of router A for announcements
going to router B, and then the `In' filter of router B for
announcements coming from router A.
</P><P>

   We call "Export Policy" of a RS-client to the set of `Out' filters
that the client would use if there was no route server. The same
applies for the "Import Policy" of a RS-client and the set of `In'
filters of the client if there was no route server.
</P><P>

   It is also common to demand from a route server that it does not
modify some BGP attributes (next-hop, as-path and MED) that are usually
modified by standard BGP speakers before announcing a route.
</P><P>

   The announcement processing model implemented by Quagga is shown in
*Note fig:rs-processing::. The figure shows a mixture of RS-clients (B,
C and D) with normal BGP peers (A). There are some details that worth
additional comments:
</P><P>

   * Announcements coming from a normal BGP peer are also considered
     for the Loc-RIBs of all the RS-clients. But logically they do not
     pass through any export policy.
</P><P>

   * Those peers that are configured as RS-clients do not receive any
     announce from the `Main' Loc-RIB.
</P><P>

   * Apart from import and export policies, `In' and `Out' filters can
     also be set for RS-clients. `In' filters might be useful when the
     route server has also normal BGP peers. On the other hand, `Out'
     filters for RS-clients are probably unnecessary, but we decided
     not to remove them as they do not hurt anybody (they can always be
     left empty).

</P><P>

10.2 Commands for configuring a Route Server
============================================
</P><P>

Now we will describe the commands that have been added to quagga in
order to support the route server features.
</P><P>

 -- Route-Server: neighbor PEER-GROUP route-server-client
 -- Route-Server: neighbor A.B.C.D route-server-client
 -- Route-Server: neighbor X:X::X:X route-server-client
     This command configures the peer given by PEER, A.B.C.D or
     X:X::X:X as an RS-client.
</P><P>

     Actually this command is not new, it already existed in standard
     Quagga. It enables the transparent mode for the specified peer.
     This means that some BGP attributes (as-path, next-hop and MED) of
     the routes announced to that peer are not modified.
</P><P>

     With the route server patch, this command, apart from setting the
     transparent mode, creates a new Loc-RIB dedicated to the specified
     peer (those named `Loc-RIB for X' in *Note Figure 10.4:
     fig:rs-processing.). Starting from that moment, every announcement
     received by the route server will be also considered for the new
     Loc-RIB.
</P><P>

 -- Route-Server: neigbor {A.B.C.D|X.X::X.X|peer-group} route-map WORD
{import|export}
     This set of commands can be used to specify the route-map that
     represents the Import or Export policy of a peer which is
     configured as a RS-client (with the previous command).
</P><P>

 -- Route-Server: match peer {A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X}
     This is a new _match_ statement for use in route-maps, enabling
     them to describe import/export policies. As we said before, an
     import/export policy represents a set of input/output filters of
     the RS-client. This statement makes possible that a single
     route-map represents the full set of filters that a BGP speaker
     would use for its different peers in a non-RS scenario.
</P><P>

     The _match peer_ statement has different semantics whether it is
     used inside an import or an export route-map. In the first case
     the statement matches if the address of the peer who sends the
     announce is the same that the address specified by
     {A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X}. For export route-maps it matches when
     {A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X} is the address of the RS-Client into whose
     Loc-RIB the announce is going to be inserted (how the same export
     policy is applied before different Loc-RIBs is shown in *Note
     Figure 10.4: fig:rs-processing.).
</P><P>

 -- Route-map Command: call WORD
     This command (also used inside a route-map) jumps into a different
     route-map, whose name is specified by WORD. When the called
     route-map finishes, depending on its result the original route-map
     continues or not. Apart from being useful for making import/export
     route-maps easier to write, this command can also be used inside
     any normal (in or out) route-map.

------------------------------------------------------------
</P><P>

We will suppose that our initial scenario is an exchange point with
three BGP capable routers, named RA, RB and RC. Each of the BGP
speakers generates some routes (with the NETWORK command), and
establishes BGP peerings against the other two routers. These peerings
have In and Out route-maps configured, named like "PEER-X-IN" or
"PEER-X-OUT". For example the configuration file for router RA could be
the following:
</P><P>

10.3.2 Configuration of the BGP routers with Route Server
---------------------------------------------------------
</P><P>

To convert the initial scenario into one with route server, first we
must modify the configuration of routers RA, RB and RC. Now they must
not peer between them, but only with the route server. For example, RA's
configuration would turn into:
</P><P>

     # Configuration for router 'RA'
     !
     hostname RA
     password ****
     !
     router bgp 65001
       no bgp default ipv4-unicast
       neighbor 2001:0DB8::FFFF remote-as 65000
     !
       address-family ipv6
         network 2001:0DB8:AAAA:1::/64
         network 2001:0DB8:AAAA:2::/64
         network 2001:0DB8:0000:1::/64

</P><P>

         neighbor 2001:0DB8::FFFF activate
         neighbor 2001:0DB8::FFFF soft-reconfiguration inbound
       exit-address-family
     !
     line vty
     !
</P><P>

   Which is logically much simpler than its initial configuration, as
it now maintains only one BGP peering and all the filters (route-maps)
have disappeared.
</P><P>

10.3.3 Configuration of the Route Server itself
-----------------------------------------------
</P><P>

As we said when we described the functions of a route server (*note
Description of the Route Server model::), it is in charge of all the
route filtering. To achieve that, the In and Out filters from the RA,
RB and RC configurations must be converted into Import and Export
policies in the route server.
</P><P>

   This is a fragment of the route server configuration (we only show
the policies for client RA):

   If you compare the initial configuration of RA with the route server
configuration above, you can see how easy it is to generate the Import
and Export policies for RA from the In and Out route-maps of RA's
original configuration.
</P><P>

   When there was no route server, RA maintained two peerings, one with
RB and another with RC. Each of this peerings had an In route-map
configured. To build the Import route-map for client RA in the route
server, simply add route-map entries following this scheme:
</P><P>

     route-map &#60;NAME&#62; permit 10
         match peer &#60;Peer Address&#62;
         call &#60;In Route-Map for this Peer&#62;
     route-map &#60;NAME&#62; permit 20
         match peer &#60;Another Peer Address&#62;
         call &#60;In Route-Map for this Peer&#62;
</P><P>

   This is exactly the process that has been followed to generate the
route-map RSCLIENT-A-IMPORT. The route-maps that are called inside it
(A-IMPORT-FROM-B and A-IMPORT-FROM-C) are exactly the same than the In
route-maps from the original configuration of RA (PEER-B-IN and
PEER-C-IN), only the name is different.
</P><P>

   The same could have been done to create the Export policy for RA
(route-map RSCLIENT-A-EXPORT), but in this case the original Out
route-maps where so simple that we decided not to use the CALL WORD
commands, and we integrated all in a single route-map
(RSCLIENT-A-EXPORT).
</P><P>

   The Import and Export policies for RB and RC are not shown, but the
process would be identical.

10.3.4 Further considerations about Import and Export route-maps
----------------------------------------------------------------
</P><P>

The current version of the route server patch only allows to specify a
route-map for import and export policies, while in a standard BGP
speaker apart from route-maps there are other tools for performing
input and output filtering (access-lists, community-lists, ...). But
this does not represent any limitation, as all kinds of filters can be
included in import/export route-maps. For example suppose that in the
non-route-server scenario peer RA had the following filters configured
for input from peer B:
</P><P>

         neighbor 2001:0DB8::B prefix-list LIST-1 in
         neighbor 2001:0DB8::B filter-list LIST-2 in
         neighbor 2001:0DB8::B route-map PEER-B-IN in
         ...
         ...
     route-map PEER-B-IN permit 10
       match ipv6 address prefix-list COMMON-PREFIXES
       set local-preference 100
     route-map PEER-B-IN permit 20
       match ipv6 address prefix-list PEER-B-PREFIXES
       set community 65001:11111
</P><P>

   It is posible to write a single route-map which is equivalent to the
three filters (the community-list, the prefix-list and the route-map).
That route-map can then be used inside the Import policy in the route
server. Lets see how to do it:
</P><P>

         neighbor 2001:0DB8::A route-map RSCLIENT-A-IMPORT import
         ...
     !
     ...
     route-map RSCLIENT-A-IMPORT permit 10
       match peer 2001:0DB8::B
       call A-IMPORT-FROM-B
     ...
     ...
     !
     route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B permit 1
       match ipv6 address prefix-list LIST-1
       match as-path LIST-2
       on-match goto 10
     route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B deny 2
     route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B permit 10
       match ipv6 address prefix-list COMMON-PREFIXES
       set local-preference 100
     route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B permit 20
       match ipv6 address prefix-list PEER-B-PREFIXES
       set community 65001:11111
     !
     ...
     ...
</P><P>

   The route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B is equivalent to the three filters
(LIST-1, LIST-2 and PEER-B-IN). The first entry of route-map
A-IMPORT-FROM-B (sequence number 1) matches if and only if both the
prefix-list LIST-1 and the filter-list LIST-2 match. If that happens,
due to the "on-match goto 10" statement the next route-map entry to be
processed will be number 10, and as of that point route-map
A-IMPORT-FROM-B is identical to PEER-B-IN. If the first entry does not
match, `on-match goto 10" will be ignored and the next processed entry
will be number 2, which will deny the route.
</P><P>

   Thus, the result is the same that with the three original filters,
i.e., if either LIST-1 or LIST-2 rejects the route, it does not reach
the route-map PEER-B-IN. In case both LIST-1 and LIST-2 accept the
route, it passes to PEER-B-IN, which can reject, accept or modify the
route.

11 VTY shell
************
</P><P>

`vtysh' is integrated shell of Quagga software.
</P><P>

   To use vtysh please specify --enable-vtysh to configure script.  To
use PAM for authentication use --with-libpam option to configure script.
</P><P>

   vtysh only searches /etc/quagga path for vtysh.conf which is the
vtysh configuration file.  Vtysh does not search current directory for
configuration file because the file includes user authentication
settings.
</P><P>

   Currently, vtysh.conf has only two commands.
</P><P>

</P><P>

11.1 VTY shell username
=======================
</P><P>

 -- Command: username USERNAME nopassword
     With this set, user foo does not need password authentication for
     user vtysh.  With PAM vtysh uses PAM authentication mechanism.
</P><P>

     If vtysh is compiled without PAM authentication, every user can
     use vtysh without authentication. vtysh requires read/write
     permission to the various daemons vty sockets, this can be
     accomplished through use of unix groups and the -enable-vty-group
     configure option.
</P><P>

11.2 VTY shell integrated configuration
=======================================
</P><P>

 -- Command: service integrated-vtysh-config
     Write out integrated Quagga.conf file when 'write file' is issued.
</P><P>

     This command controls the behaviour of vtysh when it is told to
     write out the configuration.  Per default, vtysh will instruct
     each daemon to write out their own config files when `write file'
     is issued.  However, if `service integrated-vtysh-config' is set,
     when `write file' is issued, vtysh will instruct the daemons will
     write out a Quagga.conf with all daemons' commands integrated into
     it.
</P><P>

     Vtysh per default behaves as if `write-conf daemon' is set. Note
     that both may be set at same time if one wishes to have both
     Quagga.conf and daemon specific files written out. Further, note
     that the daemons are hard-coded to first look for the integrated
     Quagga.conf file before looking for their own file.
</P><P>

     We recommend you do not mix the use of the two types of files.
     Further, it is better not to use the integrated Quagga.conf file,
     as any syntax error in it can lead to /all/ of your daemons being
     unable to start up. Per daemon files are more robust as impact of
     errors in configuration are limited to the daemon in whose file
     the error is made.

12 Filtering
************
</P><P>

Quagga provides many very flexible filtering features.  Filtering is
used for both input and output of the routing information.  Once
filtering is defined, it can be applied in any direction.

12.1 IP Access List
===================
</P><P>

 -- Command: access-list NAME permit IPV4-NETWORK
 -- Command: access-list NAME deny IPV4-NETWORK
</P><P>

   Basic filtering is done by `access-list' as shown in the following
example.
</P><P>

     access-list filter deny 10.0.0.0/9
     access-list filter permit 10.0.0.0/8
</P><P>


File: quagga.info,  Node: IP Prefix List,  Prev: IP Access List,  Up: Filtering
</P><P>

12.2 IP Prefix List
===================
</P><P>

`ip prefix-list' provides the most powerful prefix based filtering
mechanism.  In addition to `access-list' functionality, `ip
prefix-list' has prefix length range specification and sequential
number specification.  You can add or delete prefix based filters to
arbitrary points of prefix-list using sequential number specification.
</P><P>

   If no ip prefix-list is specified, it acts as permit.  If `ip
prefix-list' is defined, and no match is found, default deny is applied.
</P><P>

 -- Command: ip prefix-list NAME (permit|deny) PREFIX [le LEN] [ge LEN]
 -- Command: ip prefix-list NAME seq NUMBER (permit|deny) PREFIX [le
LEN] [ge LEN]
     You can create `ip prefix-list' using above commands.
</P><P>

    seq
          seq NUMBER can be set either automatically or manually.  In
          the case that sequential numbers are set manually, the user
          may pick any number less than 4294967295.  In the case that
          sequential number are set automatically, the sequential
          number will increase by a unit of five (5) per list.  If a
          list with no specified sequential number is created after a
          list with a specified sequential number, the list will
          automatically pick the next multiple of five (5) as the list
          number.  For example, if a list with number 2 already exists
          and a new list with no specified number is created, the next
          list will be numbered 5.  If lists 2 and 7 already exist and
          a new list with no specified number is created, the new list
          will be numbered 10.
</P><P>

    le
          `le' command specifies prefix length.  The prefix list will be
          applied if the prefix length is less than or equal to the le
          prefix length.
</P><P>

    ge
          `ge' command specifies prefix length.  The prefix list will be
          applied if the prefix length is greater than or equal to the
          ge prefix length.
</P><P>

   Less than or equal to prefix numbers and greater than or equal to
prefix numbers can be used together.  The order of the le and ge
commands does not matter.
</P><P>

   If a prefix list with a different sequential number but with the
exact same rules as a previous list is created, an error will result.
However, in the case that the sequential number and the rules are
exactly similar, no error will result.
</P><P>

   If a list with the same sequential number as a previous list is
created, the new list will overwrite the old list.
</P><P>

   Matching of IP Prefix is performed from the smaller sequential
number to the larger.  The matching will stop once any rule has been
applied.
</P><P>

   In the case of no le or ge command, the prefix length must match
exactly the length specified in the prefix list.

14 IPv6 Support
***************
</P><P>

Quagga fully supports IPv6 routing.  As described so far, Quagga
supports RIPng, OSPFv3 and BGP-4+.  You can give IPv6 addresses to an
interface and configure static IPv6 routing information.  Quagga IPv6
also provides automatic address configuration via a feature called
`address auto configuration'.  To do it, the router must send router
advertisement messages to the all nodes that exist on the network.

15 Kernel Interface
*******************
</P><P>

There are several different methods for reading kernel routing table
information, updating kernel routing tables, and for looking up
interfaces.
</P><P>

`ioctl'
     The `ioctl' method is a very traditional way for reading or writing
     kernel information.  `ioctl' can be used for looking up interfaces
     and for modifying interface addresses, flags, mtu settings and
     other types of information.  Also, `ioctl' can insert and delete
     kernel routing table entries.  It will soon be available on almost
     any platform which zebra supports, but it is a little bit ugly
     thus far, so if a better method is supported by the kernel, zebra
     will use that.
</P><P>

`sysctl'
     `sysctl' can lookup kernel information using MIB (Management
     Information Base) syntax.  Normally, it only provides a way of
     getting information from the kernel.  So one would usually want to
     change kernel information using another method such as `ioctl'.
</P><P>

`proc filesystem'
     `proc filesystem' provides an easy way of getting kernel
     information.
</P><P>

`routing socket'
</P><P>

`netlink'
     On recent Linux kernels (2.0.x and 2.2.x), there is a kernel/user
     communication support called `netlink'.  It makes asynchronous
     communication between kernel and Quagga possible, similar to a
     routing socket on BSD systems.
</P><P>

     Before you use this feature, be sure to select (in kernel
     configuration) the kernel/netlink support option 'Kernel/User
     network link driver' and 'Routing messages'.
</P><P>

     Today, the /dev/route special device file is obsolete.  Netlink
     communication is done by reading/writing over netlink socket.
</P><P>

     After the kernel configuration, please reconfigure and rebuild
     Quagga.  You can use netlink as a dynamic routing update channel
     between Quagga and the kernel.
</P><P>

16 SNMP Support
***************
</P><P>

SNMP (Simple Network Managing Protocol) is a widely implemented feature
for collecting network information from router and/or host. Quagga
itself does not support SNMP agent (server daemon) functionality but is
able to connect to a SNMP agent using the SMUX protocol (RFC1227) and
make the routing protocol MIBs available through it.

</P><P>

16.1 Getting and installing an SNMP agent
=========================================
</P><P>

There are several SNMP agent which support SMUX. We recommend to use
the latest version of `net-snmp' which was formerly known as `ucd-snmp'.
It is free and open software and available at `http://www.net-snmp.org/'
and as binary package for most Linux distributions.  `net-snmp' has to
be compiled with `--with-mib-modules=smux' to be able to accept
connections from Quagga.
</P><P>


File: quagga.info,  Node: SMUX configuration,  Next: MIB and command reference,  Prev: Getting and installing an SNMP agent,  Up: SNMP Support
</P><P>

16.2 SMUX configuration
=======================
</P><P>

To enable SMUX protocol support, Quagga must have been build with the
`--enable-snmp' option.
</P><P>

   A separate connection has then to be established between between the
SNMP agent (snmpd) and each of the Quagga daemons. This connections
each use different OID numbers and passwords. Be aware that this OID
number is not the one that is used in queries by clients, it is solely
used for the intercommunication of the daemons.
</P><P>

   In the following example the ospfd daemon will be connected to the
snmpd daemon using the password "quagga_ospfd". For testing it is
recommending to take exactly the below snmpd.conf as wrong access
restrictions can be hard to debug.
</P><P>

     /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf:
     	#
     	# example access restrictions setup
     	#
     	com2sec readonly default public
     	group MyROGroup v1 readonly
     	view all included .1 80
     	access MyROGroup "" any noauth exact all none none
     	#
     	# the following line is relevant for Quagga
     	#
     	smuxpeer .1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.5 quagga_ospfd
</P><P>

     /etc/quagga/ospf:
     	! ... the rest of ospfd.conf has been omitted for clarity ...
     	!
     	smux peer .1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.5 quagga_ospfd
     	!
</P><P>

   After restarting snmpd and quagga, a successful connection can be
verified in the syslog and by querying the SNMP daemon:
</P><P>

     snmpd[12300]: [smux_accept] accepted fd 12 from 127.0.0.1:36255
     snmpd[12300]: accepted smux peer: \
     	oid GNOME-PRODUCT-ZEBRA-MIB::ospfd, quagga-0.96.5
</P><P>

     # snmpwalk -c public -v1 localhost .1.3.6.1.2.1.14.1.1
     OSPF-MIB::ospfRouterId.0 = IpAddress: 192.168.42.109
</P><P>

   Be warned that the current version (5.1.1) of the Net-SNMP daemon
writes a line for every SNMP connect to the syslog which can lead to
enormous log file sizes.  If that is a problem you should consider to
patch snmpd and comment out the troublesome `snmp_log()' line in the
function `netsnmp_agent_check_packet()' in `agent/snmp_agent.c'.

16.3 MIB and command reference
==============================
</P><P>

The following OID numbers are used for the interprocess communication
of snmpd and the Quagga daemons. Sadly, SNMP has not been implemented
in all daemons yet.
                 (OIDs below .iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises)
     zebra	.1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.1 .gnome.gnomeProducts.zebra.zserv

     ospf6d	.1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.6 .gnome.gnomeProducts.zebra.ospf6d
</P><P>

   The following OID numbers are used for querying the SNMP daemon by a
client:
     zebra	.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.24   .iso.org.dot.internet.mgmt.mib-2.ip.ipForward
     ospfd	.1.3.6.1.2.1.14	    .iso.org.dot.internet.mgmt.mib-2.ospf

Appendix A Zebra Protocol
*************************

Zebra Protocol is a protocol which is used between protocol daemon and
zebra.  Each protocol daemon sends selected routes to zebra daemon.
Then zebra manages which route is installed into the forwarding table.

Appendix B Packet Binary Dump Format
************************************
</P><P>

Quagga can dump routing protocol packet into file with a binary format
(*note Dump BGP packets and table::).
</P><P>

   It seems to be better that we share the MRT's header format for
backward compatibility with MRT's dump logs. We should also define the
binary format excluding the header, because we must support both IP v4
and v6 addresses as socket addresses and / or routing entries.
</P><P>

   In the last meeting, we discussed to have a version field in the
header. But Masaki told us that we can define new `type' value rather
than having a `version' field, and it seems to be better because we
don't need to change header format.
</P><P>

   Here is the common header format. This is same as that of MRT.
