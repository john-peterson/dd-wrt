ABOUT:
Airoscript is a shell script designed to ease the use of aircrack-ng. It allows
you to scan, select and attack any detected access point. This is done by
detecting encryption type and proposing attacks accordingly. Various attacks
are available, such as chopchop, fragmentation attack, fakeauth, deauth,
dictionnary attacks and WPA cracking.

REQUIREMENTS:
- GNU gettext (Debian/Ubuntu: gettext package)
- ip (Debian/Ubuntu: iproute package)
- aircrack-ng 1.0 rc2
- WORKING injection capable driver for the interface you want to use
FIXME : update airosperl requeriments

change it from config file every time you have to change your Terminal Emulator.

DEVELOPERS:
Help and feedback is greatly appreciated. 
Please feel free to mail daouid at daouid@gmail.com 
or XayOn at thexayon@gmail.com for any suggestion or correction.
I will be pleased to add you to the contributors of airoscript.

ABOUT COMPLIANCE:
In the wrong hands, airoscript and aircrack-ng could easily violate the 
government certification of your radio.  A simple example is running injection
on frequencies your radio isn't certified for in your geographic region.

you and only you are responsible for making sure that your tools -- including
airoscript -- are compliant with the regulations in your country and region.

BUGS & FEATURE REQUESTS:
Please submit bugs to yo.orco@gmail.com . 
There is also forum thread in aircrack-ng official forum where you can ask 
questions, or just get updates, support etc.
You can also submit bugs to airoscript's google code page.
